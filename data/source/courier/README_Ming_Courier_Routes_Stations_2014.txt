Description:  
The Late Ming Dynasty Courier Stations and Routes were compiled primarily from the "Mingdai Yizhankao" by YANG Zhengtai, supplemented for some areas with information derived from the 1908 Postal Atlas.   

The scanned atlas pages from YANG were geocoded using heads up digitization and the CHGIS points layers.    However, a great deal of additional geocoding effort was investing, using Google maps and other base maps, to determine where particular Postal / Courier stations were located, based on their original placenames and orientation related to geographic features.

The transcription of Chinese Names was primarily done by Prof. Zhang WEI.    Additional placenames were provided by Lex Berman, who takes responsibility for errors and omissions in the data.

We feel this dataset more accurately reflects the scholarship on the Ming Postal system then the previously available datasets that were generated from the Skinner ChinaW data, and the OWTRAD data, though both of these projects were the inspiration and foundation for this publication.

The Courier Stations and Routes were developed for use in an online network analyst application, which calculates the shortest route between selected postal stations on the fly:    http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/chinapostoffice/
