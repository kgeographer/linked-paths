courier data issues
25 Oct 2016

- geometry in shapefile does not match that of TGAZ record for CHGIS_ID
  - Lex: station is not a place (settlement), i.e. not TGAZ record
    rather it is in or near that place (or should be)
    currently there are discrepancies
- route segments between SYS_IDs 745 and 84 have no intermediary nodes/places; 742, 744, 745 & 746 are missing nodes
- this data is a route system; we don't know particular course taken

the edge ends offset from these nodes are beyond tolerance (corrected in my copy)
623, 775, 627, 715, 742, 745, 638, 744, 709, 637, 379, 746, 579,
